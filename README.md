# Hash Map Function
Created by Jonathan Stilz on 3/8/24 for a Systems Design class at the University of Kentucky  
  
Creates hash map that dynamically increases and decreases its size based on a given load factor and number of inserted elements  
  
strmapbis.c and strmapbis.h hold the hash map function  
test1.c and test2.c hold sample functions that utilize the hash map function  
  
The project was developed on a Linux environment  
The line to compile using gcc would be "gcc -o test1 test1.c strmapbis.c"
